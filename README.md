# Retail Sales & Finance Dashboard

### An End-to-End Data Analytics Project

This project showcases a complete data analysis pipeline, from raw data cleaning and transformation to building an interactive business intelligence dashboard. Using a retail sales dataset, the project provides key insights into financial performance, customer trends, and sales forecasting.

-----

## üöÄ Key Features

  * **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python):** Wrote a Python script using `Pandas` to clean and prepare raw sales data, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and correcting data types.
  * **SQL-Based Business Analytics:** Developed and executed complex SQL queries to calculate core business KPIs, including total revenue, profit margin, and customer acquisition trends.
  * **Dynamic Reporting Dashboard (Excel):** Built a multi-page, interactive dashboard in Excel using Pivot Tables and Charts. The dashboard features dynamic slicers to filter data by category, region, and time.
  * **Sales Forecasting:** Implemented a simple linear regression model in Python's `scikit-learn` to forecast future sales trends, demonstrating skills in predictive analytics.
  * **Variance Analysis:** Compared actual sales against a hypothetical budget to calculate performance variance and identify key business gaps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  * **Python:** `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
  * **SQL:** SQLite
  * **Excel:** Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers
  * **Jupyter Notebook** (for initial analysis and a project walkthrough)

## üìä Project Walkthrough & Insights

### **1. Data Cleaning**

The raw dataset contained inconsistent formats and missing values. The Python script was used to clean the data and save it as a structured CSV file, ready for analysis.

### **2. Core Business Analysis (SQL)**

SQL queries were used to answer critical business questions.

**Query 1: Overall Financial Performance**
This query calculates total revenue, profit, and the overall profit margin for the business.

```sql
SELECT
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Revenue,
    SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit,
    (SUM(Profit) / SUM(Sales)) * 100 AS Profit_Margin_Percentage
FROM
    Superstore_Sales_Cleaned;
```

**Query 2: Sales & Profit by Category and Region**
This query identifies the top-performing categories and regions, which helps a business prioritize its resources.

```sql
SELECT
    Category,
    Region,
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales,
    SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit
FROM
    Superstore_Sales_Cleaned
GROUP BY
    Category,
    Region
ORDER BY
    Total_Sales DESC;
```

### **3. Interactive Dashboard**

The cleaned data was imported into Excel to create a dynamic dashboard. Key visualizations include:

  * Sales and Profit by Product Category
  * Sales over Time (to identify trends)
  * Profit by Geographic Region

### **4. Sales Forecasting**

A linear regression model was built in Python to forecast sales for the upcoming months. This serves as a basis for future budget planning and demand forecasting.
